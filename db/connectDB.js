//No database is used in this project, and only the registration part, JWT (JSON Web Token), and successful authorized data access/secured route access after entering login info is covered here....so the functionality involving DB is skipped for the time being...
//still, this folder is created just as a standard practice and to remind that this folder is also one of the basic folders that are part of any general program

// const mongoose = require('mongoose')

// const connectDB = (url) => {
//   return mongoose.connect(url, {
//     useNewUrlParser: true,
//     useCreateIndex: true,
//     useFindAndModify: false,
//     useUnifiedTopology: true,
